Core Synchronization Requirements
Local Task Tracking (Log): The system must maintain a local log that records every newly added task, along with the timestamp of its creation and a flag indicating its last sync status (synced/unsynced).

Push Logic (Local-to-Remote):

Filtering: Only tasks marked as newly added/unsynced in the local log should be considered for a push.

Duplicate Prevention: Before pushing a local task to the remote, the system must check the remote resource to ensure a task with the exact same content (task description/name AND details/properties) does not already exist. If it's an exact duplicate, the push must be skipped, and the local task's sync status should be updated to "synced."

Pull-First Sync Logic (Remote-to-Local): This process is triggered when a user initiates a sync that starts by pulling remote data.

Comparison: The system must fetch the complete remote task list and compare it against the current local task list.

Conflict Detection: If a local task exists that is not present on the remote list (i.e., it was created locally but hasn't been pushed or was deleted remotely by another client), this is considered a local conflict.

User Resolution: For every detected local conflict, the user must be prompted to verify the local task.

If the user confirms the task, it must be marked for an immediate push to the remote.

If the user rejects the task, it must be immediately and permanently deleted from the local list and log.

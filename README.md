## Getting Started

To begin implementation of the Google Tasks CLI:

1. Review the [Project Structure](project_structure.md) document to understand the intended architecture
2. Follow the [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) for a step-by-step development approach
3. Refer to the [Technical Breakdown](technical_breakdown.md) for detailed implementation guidance
4. Track progress using the [Task Tracking](task_tracking.md) document
5. Consult the [Development Roadmap](development_roadmap.md) for overall direction

## Next Steps

The planning phase is complete. The next step is to begin implementation following the roadmap, starting with:

1. Setting up the development environment
2. Creating the basic project structure
3. Implementing authentication and API integration
4. Building the core CLI functionality

Refer to Week 1 of the [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) for detailed tasks.

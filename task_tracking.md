## Notes
The recurring tasks feature has been implemented and allows users to create tasks that repeat on a regular schedule. The implementation supports common recurrence patterns like daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly, as well as custom intervals like "every 2 weeks". When a recurring task is completed, a new instance is automatically created with an appropriately updated due date.
